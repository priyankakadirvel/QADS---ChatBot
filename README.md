Project : 
Build and deploy a Question Answering (QA) system that can handle domain-specific questions in Data Science.
Use transformer models (e.g., BERT, T5) and LLMs to generate rich context responses.
Add a RAG agent to improve factual accuracy and minimize hallucinations.
Employ a combination of web scraping, manually prepared datasets, and API-driven data extraction to construct a strong document corpus.
Implement fallback mechanisms to respond to unclear, ambiguous, or off-scope questions gracefully.
Create an efficient and user-friendly architecture that can be applied in schools with limited computational capabilities.
